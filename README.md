# Safe lock with an encoder
A program for safe lock with an encoder that allows user to “open the lock” using a code entered using digits 0 9 displayed on the encoder’s LCD screen. Entering the correct code displays the word “open” and turns on the green LED. After 2 seconds the text “Closed” is displayed on the LCD screen and program returns to the beginning. Holding the encoder pressed for 2 seconds during opening allows user to set a new code. The set code is written to and read from the EEPROM memory of the controller.
(The program is written in BASCOM language - not Visual Basic)
